Hello,<br>
<br>
My name is Lan Tran, an electrical engineering-in-training.<br>
My interest is mainly with **embedded system** and **electronics**<br>
I love building electronics projects that I find interesting and useful to improve quality of life (that's what engineering is for, duh).<br>
I mainly code in **Python**, **C** and **Cpp**. I do know some **Assembly** and **System Verilog**<br>
I can design simple PCBs with Altium but desperately need to work on my soldering skills<br>
For now I work with simple uControler like **Arduino**, **ESP32** and **STM32**.<br>
I am on my journey of learning more including **Linux kernel**, **RTOS**, **8-bit uC** and some **ML models** to build something bigger and more complex (I love challenges)<br>
But first I am hacking through some **HTML/CSS** to build my first personal website!!!!<br>
